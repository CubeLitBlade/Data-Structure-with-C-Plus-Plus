# Data Structure with C Plus Plus

## Introduction
This is my version of experiment report of Hubei University, which contains simple implementations of some data strcutures using C++. However, I don't want it to be just a "workaround" for experiment report. As a matter of fact, I published my version, hoping it to be better. Please don't hesitate to share if you have a better idea for a part. Of course, if you are learning about data strcutures, I hope this will help you.

## How to use it?
The core codes for data structures are placed in the folder "DataStrcture". Each header file corresponds to an implementation of a structure. As for number named folder "X-X", they contain some easy demo based on data strcutures to get something done. The goal to be accomplished by each instance will be marked at the beginning of the file.  

## Environment
Each project runs successfully in the following environment: 
* Microsoft Windows 11
* Visual Studio Community 2022
* ISO C++ 14
If you meet compatibility problems, create one issue to explain it.

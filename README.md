# Data Structure with C Plus Plus

## Introduction
Hey, guys! This is my version of experiment report of Hubei University, which contains simple implementations of some data strcutures using C++. However, I don't want it to be just a "workaround" for trial report. As a consequence, I published it, hoping it will be better. Please don't hesitate to share if you have a better idea for a part of. Of course, if you are learning about data strcutures, I hope this will help you.

## How to use it?
### File structure
The core codes for data structures are placed in the folder "DataStructure" in the form of header files, which con. Each file corresponds to an implementation of a structure. As for number named folders, "X-X", contain easy demos based on these data strucutures classes. Each project contains a markdown file "Topic X-X" to explain the goal of corresponding project.

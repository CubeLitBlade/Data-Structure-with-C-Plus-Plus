## Introduction
Hey, guys! This is my version of experiment report of Hubei University, which contains simple implementations of some data strcutures using C++. I want each project to be relatively perfect, rather than just a "workaround", however, my programming skill are really limited so that some problems cannot be properly solved ,so don't hesitate to create a **pull request** if you have a better idea. If you happen to be studying data structure, hope you found this helpful. I hope we can all make progress. 

## How to use it?
### File structure
- **"Data Structure" Folder:** contains header files defined by data structure classes.
- **"[*Data Structure Class Name*] - XXX" Folder:**
  - **`Topic.md`:** explains the goal of this project.
  - **`main.cpp`:** accomplishes the corresponding goal.
 
### Get this repository
#### Go with Git
If you have installed Git, you will be able to run the following command in **Terminal** to get it. 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CubeLitBlade/Data-Structure-with-C-Plus-Plus.git
```
#### Go with Visual Studio
If you have installed Visual Studio, you can **copy** the following link. 
```bash
https://github.com/CubeLitBlade/Data-Structure-with-C-Plus-Plus.git
```
Then launch your Visual Studio, click **"Clone a repository"**. Then **paste** the link to **"Repository location"** and choose the path to store it. Last, click **"Clone"**. 

#### Just download zip
If you want to download the source code simply, you can click **"<> Code"** on the repository page, then choose **"Download ZIP"**.

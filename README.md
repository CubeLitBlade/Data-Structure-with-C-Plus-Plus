## Introduction
Hey, guys! This is my version of experiment report of Hubei University, which contains simple implementations of some data strcutures using C++. I want each project to be relatively perfect, rather than just a "workaround", however, my programming skill are really limited so that some problems cannot be properly solved ,so don't hesitate to create a **pull request** if you have a better idea. If you happen to be studying data structure, hope you found this helpful. I hope we can all make progress. 

## How to use it?
### File structure
The core codes for data structures are placed in the folder "DataStructure" in the form of header files, which con. Each file corresponds to an implementation of a structure. As for number named folders, "X-X", contain easy demos based on these data strucutures classes. Each project contains a markdown file "Topic X-X" to explain the goal of corresponding project. 

### Get this repository
